# Papercups

Papercups is an open source live customer chat web app written in Elixir. We offer a hosted version at [app.papercups.io](https://app.papercups.io/).

You can check out how our chat widget looks and play around with customizing it on our [demo page](https://app.papercups.io/demo/). The chat widget component is also open sourced at [github.com/papercups-io/chat-widget](https://github.com/papercups-io/chat-widget).

_Watch how easy it is to get set up with our Slack integration ðŸš€ :_

## Getting started

To start your server:

The fastest way to get started is one click deploy on Heroku with:

<a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/papercups-io/papercups"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" width="200px" /></a>

## Philosophy

We wanted to make a self-hosted version of tools like Intercom and Drift for companies that have privacy and security concerns about having customer data going to third party services. Weâ€™re starting with chat right now but we want to expand into all forms of customer communication like email campaigns and push notifications.

Stay tuned! We'll be posting a more detailed roadmap soon ðŸ¤“
